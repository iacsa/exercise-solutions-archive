# Exercises

My implementations of small programming exercises, from various websites.



## [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/)

[My solutions](./codeeval)

### Pros:

* Web-interface for submitting solutions
* Solutions are scored depending on correctness, speed and memory usage.

### Cons:

* Selection of languages is lacking
* No way to test solutions before a submit
* At the time of writing, the scoring of solutions is __very__ slow
* (Almost?) No social component



## [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/)

[My solutions](./exercism)

### Pros:

* Good selection of languages
* Peer reviews
* Has tool for downloading test-suites and uploading solutions,
  so you can work in your own programming environment

### Cons:

* Depending on the language, potentially small number of problems


## [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

[My solutions](./hackerrank)

### Pros:

* Good selection of languages
* Web-interface for submitting solutions
* Simple test cases to validate solutions before submit
* Regular rated contests

### Cons:

* Problem statements often not very clear
* Given examples / test cases often trivial
